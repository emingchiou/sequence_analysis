sequence_analysis

# Specific pattern: 

-Aim: To extract protein sequence with a specific pattern. 

-Ex: Is there protein sequences with G and E content over 40% within 100 consecutive amino acids in human? Where do they locate at?  

-Input: Species, target aa (1~3 kinds of aa), among how many consecutive aa, percentage threshold.

-Output: The extracted sequences, in which protein sequence, at which position, percentage. Files in FASTA and csv format.

# Basic information:

-Aim: Easy-to-use tool for basic imformation of DNA sequences.

-Input: DNA sequence ID/ sequence, User's E-mail,

-Output: CG contents, transcribed mRNA, encoded protein, forward/reverse primers. Shown in the window or send to user's email.
