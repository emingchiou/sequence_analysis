sequence_analysis

# Specific pattern: 

-Aim: To extract protein sequences with a high percentage of certain amino acids. 

-Ex: Is there protein sequences with G and E content over 40% within 100 consecutive amino acids in human? Where do they locate at?  

-Input: Species, among how many consecutive aa, target aa (1~3 kinds of aa), sum of the aa or respective percentage, percentage threshold. 

-Output: The extracted sequences, protein ID, position of the interval, the percentage. Files were in FASTA and csv format.

# Basic information:

-Aim: Easy-to-use tool for basic information of DNA sequences.

-Input: DNA sequence ID/ sequence, User's E-mail,

-Output: CG contents, transcribed mRNA, encoded protein, forward/reverse primers. Shown in the window.
